💜 About the project
---
Memetics is a turn-based online card game for two players. The fun part is that each match uses a random deck full of meme cards — every card has its own stats, and some come with special effects.

The main goal is to drop your opponent’s health to zero. To do that you’ll need to think a few steps ahead, keep track of your mana, and use your cards in the smartest way possible.
